With this mindset, I approach every project with the sensitivity that if I touch it, I will ensure those who interact with my solution are delighted that someone took the time to craft the experience just the way they expect it; For them, all touchpoints are intuitive, cohesive, and flow.

            <h2 class="text-center">The Backstory</h2>
            <p>My professional journey began back in the early 90's. I started my creative career attending college at the Maryland Institute College of Art <a href="https://www.mica.edu/">(MICA)</a>. Here, I studied Visual Communication - Graphic Design, learning "on-the-board" layout and other traditional artistic skills. Desktop publishing was in its infancy and advanced technology was no more familiar to most than cumbersome microwave ovens, nearly unprogramable VCRs, and painfully slow dial-up internet connectivity with the concept of receiving your mail electronically on a computer.</p>
			<p>During my time in college, I decided to enlist in the Marine Corps with the goal of becoming a fighter pilot after graduation. However, I began my service as a field radio operator and scout swimmer in a reserve Light Armored <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance">Reconnaissance</a> Battalion - a significant deviation from my art school studies where I was encouraged to push boundaries and question norms. Despite this, my time in the Marines played a crucial role in shaping my professional career and approach to work. It instilled in me the values of attention to detail, accountability, and perfectionism, where doing more with less is a way-of-life. The Marines also taught me the importance of leadership, teamwork, and a mission-oriented, failure is not an option mindset. Furthermore, my experience in the military taught me the value of gathering information, analyzing details, and documenting everything, no matter how small it may seem. These attributes have become a hallmark of my approach to experience design work and investigative research.</p>  
			<p>Not all went as planned with my pilot aspirations due to an accident. In turn, I landed a graphics job as a government contractor creating illustration and presentation material in MacDraw Pro for two directors of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization at the Pentagon. I worked here for two years before I was offered an opportunity to work at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory <a href="https://www.jhuapl.edu/">(JHU/APL)</a>.</p>
			<p>APL became my training ground for catapulting my professional career. Here, I worked in the Technical Communications group, serving an 11-department organization covering a variety of work for various government agencies and organizations. During my tenure at APL, I covered all aspects of graphics creation by working in all of the group's functional areas, learning each of the service offerings and capabilities except for manning a press and copier in the print shop.</p>
			<p>My first role was creating traditional print and graphics materials for presentations, proposals, and trade-show installations in the Publications group. All the work was digital including pre-press for print. Technical illustration and renderings were done in Illustrator or Photoshop and depending on the complexity, could take a week to complete. Changes to the work were common as engineering concepts changed and evolved. Seeing this, I seized an opportunity to take advantage of the academic always-learning culture of the lab. I began to learn how to create illustrations using 3D software and was allowed to purchase a cutting-edge Silicon Graphics computer - teaching myself Alias|Wavefront, Softimage, and the next generation of high-end computer-generated imagery (CGI) software Maya Version 1.</p>		
			<p>I began to include my 3D content and animation capability with interactive multimedia presentations. QuickTime VR allowed me to include 3D environments and objects in Macromedia Director presentations and leverage Shockwave 3D capabilities for interactivity. Using cutting-edge 3D content creation tools, I looked for additional ways of adding value to the group under the department's "Quicker, Faster, Better" initiative. By looking for efficiencies in the development process, I began to team with CAD engineers using ProE to create virtual prototypes for visualization and simulation. I spent time investigating file transfer and model-sharing capabilities between the systems.</p>
			<p>Demand for modeling, simulation, and visualization began to increase and to deliver state-of-the-art output, I moved into the video production group. Here, I became a full-time animator. I was spending all of my time learning every aspect of high-end CGI and motion graphics creation with an emphasis on broadcast quality output. Working daily in Maya, I was able to leverage scripting to drive simulations.</p>
