				<h3>Project Summary</h3>
			  </div>
				<h6>Role</h6>
				<ul>
					<li>Project Experience Design Director</li>
					<li>Principal Experience Designer</li>
					<li>Lead BX/UX Researcher</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<h6>Ambition &amp; Scope</h6>
				<p>EY’s Global Risk Management team engaged the Enterprise Technology organization to assist in the definition and delivery of a transformational Incident Management Experience (IMX). The project aimed to bring together a diverse information ecosystem to create an automated and cohesive experience for executing command, control, and communications for situations that impact staff and business operations. Flexibility, efficiency, scalability, and pervasive access were also essential for success.</p> 
				<p>Technically, the solution would leverage Microsoft's cloud service platform, facilitating automation, instant collaboration, and overall management of events - interfacing with <a href="https://www.everbridge.com/products/mass-notification-and-incident-communications/">Everbridge's Mass notification platform</a> and other system's data.</p>
				<p>The solution needed to reach five global regions, 150 countries, 700 office locations, each with a location-specific crisis management plan and readiness checklists for over 90 incident-type categories - all with associated templates.</p>
				<br>
				<h6>Result</h6>
				<p>My research led user centered design approach and robust product development background allowed for the successful creation and deployment of an MVP. A scalable framework other organizations could customize for their own needs was also delivered.
				</p>
				<p>A time-measured >90% operational efficiency increase was achieved - exceeding expectations. Unveiled at EY’s Global Security conference in Boston, MA the solution was revered by the international attendees.</p>
				<p>The Global Risk Management organization's leadership was eager to externally socialize and further develop the solution after seeing immediate value. Additional enhancement funding was awarded.

			<br><br>
          	</div>
			<p>As a globally distributed team of 15, my initial work was planning and conducting a virtual collaborative design thinking workshop as a needs analysis exercise. The effort allowed the project team to better understand the problem space - ensuring all stakeholder's base needs and any known dependencies were identified.</p>
			<p>With the workshop output, I created a quick low-fidelity sketch of the concept discussed to facilitate team discussion around the vision. Many on the team were subject matter experts in their domain, but product development was new for them. Here, I brought my development expertise to lead the team through a structured design process.</p>

				<h3>Needs Analysis &amp; Requirements Gathering</h3>
			  </div>
				<p>Deep investigative research began. I planned and moderated multiple design thinking workshops in Miro capturing business, technical, and user needs.</p>

					<img class="img-fluid" src="imx/collaboration_space_1.png" alt="Workshop question capture">
					<br><br>
				</div>
				<p>Where requirements gaps were identified and questions remained, I performed follow-up contextual inquiry with individual subject matter experts from various locations to better understand specific end-user needs, current workflows, regional and regulatory constraints, along with other critical aspects required for solution definition and overall success.</p>
				<br>

					<br><br>
					<img class="img-fluid" src="imx/telemetry_metrics.png" alt="Workshop question capture">
					<br><br>
				</div>
				<p>In parallel, I performed expert reviews of existing systems, identified additional dependencies, and conducted follow-up workshops to close experience gaps in the existing highly manual process. Findings from the reviews were used to establish an experience baseline on which improvement metrics would be measured.</p>
				<br>
				<div class="col-12 text-center">
					<img class="img-fluid" src="imx/creation_logic.png" alt="Workshop question capture">
				<br><br>
				</div>
				<p> Through needs analysis, a variety of primary and sub-processes were identified. I captured all user type workflows along with associated systems, data, and documents considered input, output, or conditional triggers. Unique user attributes were captured based on location, rank, role, incident type, associated tasks, etc., which all informed user personas.</p>
				<p>A composite picture of an incident flow was created which had never been documented. Subject matter experts verified accuracy and brought additional components unique to specific roles and conditions which required handling.</p>
				<br>
				<div class="col-12 text-center">
					<img class="img-fluid" src="imx/Base_requirements.png" alt="Workshop question capture">
				<br><br>
				</div>
				<p>Requirements were documented collaboratively in Miro during participatory virtual workshops and then moved into an Excel framework where use cases were tracked for collective stakeholder sorting, review,input, and prioritization.</p>

				<img class="img-fluid" src="imx/Workshop_questions.png" alt="Workshop question capture">
				</div>
				<br><br>
				<p>As requirements developed and evolved, I created a formal structured Microsoft Word template for detailed documentation and version control. This approach was necessary for total requirements traceability, scope creep elimination, and final user acceptance test case preparation. The formal Word document would ultiately become the single source of truth for the entire solution and the blueprit that a selected external developer would follow when coding the production system.</p>
